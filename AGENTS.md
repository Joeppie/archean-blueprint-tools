# AGENTS.md — development guide

This repo reverse-engineers the **Archean** game's `blueprint.json` format and
provides a zero-build browser viewer/inspector. Everything is static: plain ES
modules + Three.js from CDN. No bundler, no npm.

## Layout
```
viewer/index.html + view3d.js   the inspector (Three.js core module)
viewer/tests.js                 the headless suites (selftest/proxytest/comptest/
                                uitest/gizmatest/postest), split out of view3d.js
                                in v0.169; driven via the window.HARCHEAN hooks
                                object (live getters+setters). Loaded ONLY for
                                suite URLs (dynamic import in index.html)
viewer/hullfit.js               exact hull-lattice mapping (pure function, no THREE)
viewer/blockshapes.js           block shape+orientation table (type -> geometry/faces)
viewer/palette.js               the game's built-in 256-slot palette + slot resolution
viewer/models/                  real game component models: manifest.json (mass,
                                renderable node tree, joints, adapters, colliders
                                per type) + <Type>.json geometry, lazy-loaded
regtest/regtest.html            format-validation suite over testdata/ (importable)
testdata/<workshop-id>/blueprint.json   regression corpus (25 craft + 9000000001
                                orient fixture, 1 kB..530 kB)
tools/adjust_seat.py            reference example of a safe format edit
tools/make_orient_test.py       regenerates the chirality probe craft 9000000001
tools/make_landing.py         regenerates the landing gallery + viewer/workshop.json
tools/add_workshop.py <id>      ingest a locally-subscribed workshop craft
                                (names: tools/ws-names.tsv, fetched slowly — Steam rate-limits)
tools/extract_models.py         regenerates viewer/models/ from an installed game
tools/security-scan.py          checkin gate: secret-shape scan (--staged/--tree/
                                --history) + release-string sync (--versions)
tools/install-hooks.sh          ONE-PER-CLONE: installs tests/pre-commit into .git
tests/pre-commit                the mandatory gate hook (see Checkin gate below)
tools/perfprobe.py URL [s]      real-clock headless perf probe (DevTools ws;
                                ?perf titles under --virtual-time-budget are
                                meaningless — clocks/rAF freeze there)
tests/run_tests.sh              headless-Chromium test runner (selftest+regtest+renders)
FORMAT.md                       format documentation (start here)
PERF.md                         measured perf baseline + harmful-candidate catalogue

```
Headless render shots — use the **AMD iGPU** (~1 s/shot, full budgets):
```bash
VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/radeon_icd.json \
chromium --headless=new --no-sandbox --disable-dev-shm-usage \
  --use-gl=angle --use-angle=vulkan --window-size=1400,900 \
  --virtual-time-budget=15000 --screenshot=out.png <url>   # --dump-dom for titles
```
VK_ICD_FILENAMES hides the NVIDIA ICD from chromium entirely — the discrete
GPU usually runs the user's AI models and MUST NOT be contended (quick check:
`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used --format=csv`; if busy,
keep the iGPU pin). tests/run_tests.sh does this by default (whole suite ~6 s).
GPU=0 = SwiftShader CPU fallback: every virtual frame costs 13-300 ms wall,
screenshots at virtual budgets ≥10 s never complete (wall-time cliff) — keep
budgets ≤8000 in that mode.
NOTE: to kill a dev server, use `pkill -f "[h]ttp.server 8650"` — plain
`pkill -f "http.server 8650"` also matches (kills) the calling shell.

## Checkin gate (mandatory — the hook is the enforcement)
Every commit passes `tests/pre-commit` (install once: `bash
tools/install-hooks.sh`): (1) `tools/security-scan.py --staged` — the staged
blobs are scanned for CREDENTIAL SHAPES (private keys, GitHub/AWS/Google/
Slack/npm/PyPI/OpenAI tokens, JWTs, ssh keys, basic-auth URLs, Steam WebAPI
`key=<32hex>`, password/token assignments) — any hit blocks the commit;
(2) `--versions` — when a release-string file (or the viewer) is staged, ALL
context-anchored `v0.NN` strings (viewer title/header, `view3d.js?v=NN`,
README ×2, landing ×2) must agree, so the release ritual can never ship a
mismatched build. Deep scans: `--tree` and `--history` (every blob of every
revision). Baseline audit 2026-10-09: tree (250 files) + history (1211 blobs)
= ZERO secret hits; no emails/IPs/tokens in the tree. INTENTIONAL, audited,
public data: testdata blueprints carry workshop authors + timestamps
(NOTICE §2), ws-names.tsv the public craft titles; the git identity
(GitHub noreply, public by design) is author metadata, not repo content. No CI
secrets exist (Pages builds from the branch; no workflow files).
(3) v0.161: when ANY `viewer/` file is staged, the hook runs
`tests/run_tests.sh --gate` — the headless SELFTEST + REGTEST smoke pair
over the tree (~5 s, iGPU-pinned; chromium present required). Gate PASS is
commit proof; the full suite (uitest/gizmatest/postest/renders) stays the
release ritual's job. (2026-10-09 remediation: the user F5'd the dev server
mid-session, saw a selftest FAIL under the SAME v0.160 label as the pushed
release, and reasonably concluded the release was broken.)

## Publishing (GitHub Pages)
The live site is the repo root served by GitHub Pages:
`https://joeppie.github.io/archean-blueprint-tools/viewer/index.html`.
`git push origin main` is all it takes — Pages rebuilds automatically (the build is an Actions job: during GitHub Actions runner incidents
typically queues "waiting for a hosted runner" — check githubstatus.com before suspecting the push)
(README viewer link is versioned; bump `v0.xx` in index.html title/header,
landing page and README together when the viewer changes). v0.161 rule:
**bump the version strings at SESSION START, not at release** — the dev
server (:8650) serves the working tree, so an in-progress tree must carry
the NEXT version label; a dev snapshot wearing the last release's string is
indistinguishable from the pushed build (2026-10-09 user report).

## Sources of truth (all offline — do NOT web-fetch to answer format questions)
- **FORMAT.md is the knowledge base.** Everything reverse-engineered lives
  there (grid maths, block culling rules, hull triangle exact lattice, linear
  colour/PBR semantics, palette defaults, gltf material factors, conditional
  wheel parts, .ini placement rules). Read it before investigating anything.
- Game assets on disk: `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Archean/Archean-game/modules/<module>/components/<Type>/<Type>.{gltf,ini}`
  = ground truth for models/materials/node trees (read the `.gltf` materials +
  `.ini` directly; regenerate `viewer/models/` after extractor changes).
- The dev's own viewer (https://viewer.xenontools.dev/, js modules under /js/)
  is the reference implementation for genuinely NEW format questions. When
  used, transcribe the finding into FORMAT.md + code comments in the SAME
  commit so the knowledge stays offline (see FORMAT.md § Local sources of
  truth, and NOTICE.md §2 for its GPL-adjacent porting terms).

## Format facts (verified — do not re-derive)
- 1 grid cell = 0.25 m; `pos_*` ∈ 0..12; `frame_*` in 3 m units;
  `world = (pos − 5.5)·0.25 + frame·3.0`. −z is the nose (this craft).
- **Unity left-handed orientation:** `orientation` is a left-handed quaternion; a
  right-handed renderer must use the conjugate `{w,−x,−y,−z}` (raw `q` mirrors the
  game — beacons lean the wrong way, casters pitch the wrong way, wheels go inboard).
  Verified: `position + R(q*)·adapter_local` reproduces the game-written `data.pipes`
  endpoints to 0.000 m (raw `q` is 0.18-0.66 m off). Viewer converts to a z-mirrored
  view space `pos (x,y,−z)`, `quat (w,x,y,−z)`; all data/reports stay raw. See
  FORMAT.md § Handedness.
- **Rotation storage has TWO conventions keyed on `data.colors` (v108):**
  palette-less legacy files (2024-25 corpus, 23 of them) store the Unity LH
  quaternion **RAW** — the game places with `R(q)` (proof: mosaic craft
  3334698274's dashboard murals are flush only under raw: |dot| 0.999,
  conj = 45° out of the wall; selftest `mural=true`); palette-bearing 2026
  files store the **conjugate** (ISW pipes 0.000 m under `R(q*)`). Viewer:
  `LEGACY_Q` (set in `setModel`) switches `viewQuat`/`rawFromView` between
  `(w,−x,−y,z)` (legacy) and `(w,x,y,−z)` (modern). This also explains the
  dev viewer: raw placement is exact for legacy craft ("renders the mosaic
  perfectly") and 45°-tilted for 2026 ones. See FORMAT.md § Handedness.
- Blocks: `type` = shape+orientation (0 cube, 1-12 slope [4 = thin tilted
  rod], 13-20 corner, 21-44 pyramid, 45-52 inverse corner — table in
  `viewer/blockshapes.js`, transcribed from the game's BlockShapes.hh via the
  dev's XenonViewer); `colors[7]` = palette slot per face (face order in
  blockshapes.js). Interior-wall culling (ported from XenonViewer): full faces
  cut cell-by-cell against a full-face grid in absolute cell coords, surviving
  cells stitched back into rectangles; partial/slant faces die when fully
  cell-covered, and two blocks presenting the SAME partial-face footprint
  (slope glued to slope) form an interior partition — both copies drop.
  Subgrids: `Build` components carry nested blueprint data
  (hatches/doors), stored CLOSED at grid coords.
- Components' `occupancies` are mirrored by type-255 entries in `data.blocks`.
  **Any save must keep them in sync** (round(delta/0.25) cells, both places).
- Save format must serialize byte-identical to the game's JS:
  `json.dumps(..., separators=(',',':'), ensure_ascii=False)` — no spaces,
  key order preserved, no reformatting.
- `components[].colors` may be a dict (`color1`/`color2`) in v2 files — handle both.
- Hull triangles: vertices live on the SAME lattice as blocks —
  `world_ax = (v_ax + W·frame_ax)·pitch_ax + C_ax` with **W=12, pitch=0.25,
  C=−1.5** exactly (v are cell-slot integers, cross-frame weld pairs sit
  Δv = 12). The old per-file pitch fit (≈0.23-0.29) was an approximation that
  left the skin 3-15 % off the block hull — do not reintroduce it. Shared
  slots = welded points; winding order flips the normal. The game renders
  each triangle as a closed 0.05 m prism: colours[0] front, colours[1] back,
  colours[2..4] the side walls along edges v0-v1, v1-v2, v2-v0 (all five
  colours matter; ISW-241 uses slots 0, 4, 51 = hull, glass, chrome).
- `pipes` segments: `dir` 0..5 = +x,+y,+z,−x,−y,−z; the first/last segment ends
  are world-space connector positions (trace pipes to place ports). Pipes are
  NOT straight chains — every segment anchors at its OWN `start` (joints have
  0.04-0.14 m offsets; accumulating dir*len drifts tubes off the cables).
  Endpoints ARE the connection points: the game writes cable tips at the
  part's VISIBLE socket, which can differ from the `.ini` [ADAPTER] position
  (battery socket on the front face; adapters = bottom terminal grid). Draw
  paths exactly as recorded — adapter-snapping endpoints + taper-shifting
  paths is the v0.99 regression (broken lines, nubs off the model): do not
  reintroduce. Cable-free adapter nubs >0.5 m from the part origin are
  build-time flanges (SolarPanel's spare ports sit 1.0 m below the pivot =
  "red & blue spheres on the ground under the panel") — skip them.
  FluidJunction cables are cached in the builder's FLAT frame (outlets up,
  row along fuselage) — the junction's display pose matches that frame
  (mirror-conjugate file quat), which is why the comb lies flat along its
  pipes. See FORMAT.md.
- `components[].type === 'Build'` = editor construction-site ghost, far outside
  the bbox — never render it as geometry.
- **Subgrids** (v0.153, join decoded v0.154; placement model corrected v0.168):
  Build components carrying nested blueprints (doors/hatches) live as ONE
  Group per Build (`userData.sub`); the group BASE is the IDENTITY and nested
  content sits at its PARENT-frame absolute coords. Build.position/
  orientation = the builder's construction-site GHOST/bench pose (like the
  top-level Build ghost, far outside the bbox), applied on top as a DISPLAY
  offset — NOT an origin. (The old "BuildMatrix∘local" attach model
  double-offsets absolute content: SU-57 gear doors rendered x=±39 =
  "exploded out", and the subgrid gizmo parked at the group origin = the
  Build bench pose, metres from its doors = "rotation on the dolphin doesn't
  work".) The Mount is DECODED, not
  guessed: `composite_builds[].slaveBuildId` = the Build's index in the
  FLATTENED component array (nested content numbers BEFORE its Build,
  recursive subtree sizes — dev readBuild order); exact for 342/342 corpus
  entries. Masters are any part type (hinges/pivots kinematic, dashboards/
  RTGs/batteries static hosts, metres away); joint state lives on the MASTER
  (`angle` DEGREES / `pos` metres; dolphin doors ride real pivots 0/126/180°
  via the SmallPivot master angle, NOT the Build pose). **v0.157 joint drive:**
  masters with a
  manifest `joints[0]` (SmallHinge/SmallPivot/Aileron/LinearTrack — NOT
  Lamp/SpotLight, whose joints = [] and whose `angle` is the light aim)
  ANIMATE their subgrid: axis = viewQuat(master)·axleEuler(ZYX)·x̂, pivot =
  viewPos(master) + viewQuat·(mirror_z axle.position); group pose
  p' = pivot + R(axis,angle)·(base.p−pivot) (+axis·pos), q' = R·base.q
  (`syncSubJoints()`, runs from buildSubgrids + every markDirty; the panel
  Mount row exposes editable joint-angle/slide sliders that write the
  master's data verbatim). Subgrid display pose lives in `g.userData.base`
  {p,q} (identity at load) — pivot rows + gizmo edit BASE, never the live
  transform; a pure SPIN must not rewrite the ghost position fields (they are
  the Build twin's symmetry key — applySubGizmo gates the write on a nonzero
  move delta). Pins: selftest
  `subjoin`, dolphin/XYQ postest sub-master fixtures, dolphin
  `subjoint-angle` (sign-sensitive 90° spin about the decoded axis),
  dolphin `subgizmo-rot` (v0.168 WYSIWYG: a gizmo ring spin orbits the
  subgrid's CONTENT CENTRE, spins it in place, lever > 5 m, exact restore),
  3732302108 `subjoint-pos` (LinearTrack slide ∥ axle). See FORMAT.md
  §Subgrids.
- Palette slots: `data.colors[256]`, entry = {r,g,b 0-255, opacity 0-15,
  roughness 0-7, metallic 0|1}. **r/g/b are LINEAR albedo** — the engine's
  shaders use them raw; decoding as sRGB darkens the craft ~^2.2 (the ISW-241
  navy read as black). `opacity < 15` ⇒ transparent, alpha = (opacity+1)/16
  (`opacity < 8` = glass). The engine re-imposes slots 0..10 over the file.
  Metal is shaded as metallic·(1 − roughness/7): the game's tracer lights all
  roughness>0 surfaces diffusely, so metalness=1 would wrongly darken painted
  parts (color1's default is metallic 0, roughness 0). See `viewer/palette.js`.
- **v1 files (23 of the 24 corpus!) carry NO `data.colors` at all**: block
  slots and v1 `components[].colors` (a `[slot,slot]` **index pair**, not a
  dict) reference the built-in legacy palette — four 17-colour finish
  families: matte 40..56, polished 84..100, metal 128..144, glass 172..188
  (full table in `viewer/palette.js`, ported from the dev viewer, NOTICE §2).
  **v1 family bases are 4 slots below these v2 bases** (polished 80..96, metal
  120..136, glass 160..176) — the v2 built-in table leaves those v1 indices in
  the empty gaps = the purple blocks (26/61 files). `legacySlot()` remaps
  +4/+8/+12 for palette-less (v1) files only. An all-purple craft = missing
  built-in groups (magenta = missing-slot marker), not a broken file. See FORMAT.md.
- **Dashboard geometry is GENERATED from `data` (glTF = editor template):**
  board = box origin→(size_x/100, size_y/100, 0.01) — CENTIMETRES, corner
  pivot, plane X·Y normal +z; elements at pos/100 z 0.01..0.02; dataport
  re-centred at (w/2,h/2,0); colours 0-255 LINEAR with metal/rough off
  0..255. Viewer `buildDashboard()` (dev-viewer port). Hull UI: blocks +
  triangles share ONE "hull" toggle; the hull-opacity slider fades blocks,
  triangle skin AND the wireframe overlay (v0.149 — lattice pitch/offset
  sliders + auto-fit button REMOVED: the exact fit applies silently).
- Component models: game ships per component a `.gltf` (materials named
  `color1`/`color2` = player-painted surfaces ⇄ `components[].colors`, plus
  fixed materials whose `pbrMetallicRoughness` baseColorFactor/metallic/
  roughness factors are the real colours — tire 0.013 black, body 0.01-0.03
  black, pin/chrome rough 0, connectors (0,.05,.5)/(0.5,0,0)/(0.5,.15,0)
  LINEAR — factors are glTF defaults when absent: color 0.8 grey, metal 1,
  rough 1) and an `.ini` (mass, `[RENDERABLE]` node tree, `[JOINT]` with
  angular limits, `[TARGET]` frame nodes, `[ADAPTER]` port positions, collider
  box). `extract_models.py` packs these into `viewer/models/`. **Placement
  truth is the `.ini` tree** (renderable/joint/target parents, euler order
  **ZYX** like the game engine); gltf node translations are Blender authoring
  offsets (MiniComputer's geometry sits 3 m from its origin, Beacon's base
  node +0.339 z vs the .ini −0.339 y) and must NOT be baked into geometry —
  node parents may reference each other in ANY order, so build the whole node
  map first, then link. Some renderables are CONDITIONAL: a Wheel/BigWheel
  gltf carries both tire toruses (`data.reverse` picks one) and an optional
  mudguard (`data.mudguard === false` removes it) — showing all stacks a
  double tire. Real models are dense (raytracing-grade): the viewer shows
  low-poly proxies by default (boxes + hexagon cylinders) and swaps in real
  geometry only via the “real game models” checkbox / `?real` (persisted in
  localStorage key `archean-real-models-v2` — v0.139 bumped the key so fresh
  opens honour the user-set defaults: hull on, wireframe off, labels off,
  real models off). `Build` type has no model (skipped).

## Performance rules (iGPU-targeted — keep them)
- Static geometry is MERGED: blocks → one mesh per distinct palette colour
  (crafts use a handful; materials are real PBR per colour, full faces are
  stitched to rectangles so a 3 m deck = 2 quads), block+wire edges →
  1 LineSegments (vertex-coloured), occupancy
  boxes → 1 line mesh, pipes → 1 mesh, streamlines → 1 LineSegments, all
  adapter nubs → 1 mesh per port type (world-merged, rebuilt on edit).
- Data structures (v0.155 audit): per-frame and per-edit queries go through
  hash indexes, never linear scans — aero plates get a uniform-grid SUPERSET
  index (3×3×3 probe of 1.5 m cells ≥ max influence 1.48 m; exact slab/r2
  tests run on the result = bit-identical streamlines) above 200 plates;
  below that the ~6 ns allocation-free scan beats 27 hash probes (adaptive,
  `aeroUseGrid`; giant craft 1024 plates 6.5→5.0 ms, airliner 92 plates must
  KEEP the scan — grid measured 2.4→5.0 regression). All per-frame cell keys
  are INTEGERS (`cellKeyV` base-8192 encoding; string keys regressed the
  giant 6.5→7.5, PERF.md #8). serialize()'s type-255 mirror sync (live
  Map index, sequential semantics preserved) and syncAdapters (Map by comp
  index, invalidated at the setModel queue rebuild) index likewise.
- Rendering is ON-DEMAND: call `invalidate()` after anything changes; the
  loop only draws on invalidation, controls movement, or while flow is on.
  Never reintroduce unconditional per-frame `renderer.render`.
- Material sharing is intentionally NOT done for component materials:
  selection highlight writes `material.emissive` per mesh (shared materials
  would light up every component of that colour).
- `renderer.setPixelRatio` is floored at 1 (capped at 2.5, re-applied in
  onResize): browser zoom-out drops `devicePixelRatio` below 1, and
  feeding that through renders the canvas BELOW CSS resolution — upscaled
  = the user's "zoomed in and grainy" on fresh opens. NOTE: Chrome PERSISTS
  per-site zoom across reloads (Ctrl-F5 keeps it; only Ctrl+0 resets), so
  HiDPI+zoom gives dpr 3 — the cap is 2.5, not 2, to keep those sharp.
  view3d also COUNTERACTS Chrome's PERSISTED SITE ZOOM (set by Ctrl+wheel
  over the canvas — Chrome grabs it before the page; saved in profile
  content settings, which apply in INCOGNITO too and survive Ctrl-F5:
  the user's "random stuck zoomed viewer, incognito, fixed by monitor
  move"). Mechanism: baseline dpr = lowest seen (localStorage) with
  zoom-in cancelled by inverse CSS zoom; cold/incognito starts factor
  devicePixelRatio into standard OS scales × Chrome zoom steps and undo
  zoom-IN only (deliberate zoom-outs respected; dpr 1.5625 = 125% screen
  × 125% zoom). Escape hatches: `?nozoom`, View-Options "reset page zoom"
  button; the Chrome-side entry only Ctrl+0 clears.
  `fitCameraToModel` frames at `max(1.85r, 3.6m)` — a 1 m craft framed at
  1.1 m felt like "stuck zoom, tiny FOV, low res" (the user's report;
  fly-to never runs on load — canvas click / list dblclick only).
- `?perf` writes `draw=<renderer.info.render.calls>` into the title; the
  ISW-241 scene is ≈150 draws. SwiftShader fps numbers are meaningless —
  compare draw-call counts only.

## Known open issues (v0.146 state)
- **v0.143/v0.145 were REVERTED** (user-confirmed regressions on Pages: beacon mast +
  aileron real models rotated wrong). v0.144 (IBL) was re-landed as the PMREM commit.
  Re-land the legacy alignment + per-asset loader bake ONLY with new pins first
  (real Beacon mast tip in world, comptest-grade; aileron real-model tip below hinge
  on a palette file) — existing pins are sign-invariant on axisymmetric parts, so a
  bake flip passes the suite silently. Details: FORMAT.md § Per-asset gltf loader
  conventions.
- Beacon "point forward" display convention (user): parked — blocked on an asymmetric
  probe craft (180°-quaternion z-sign ambiguity, see FORMAT.md).

## Invariants that tests enforce (keep them green)
1. `?selftest`: edit→serialize round-trip preserves bytes except intended fields;
   occupancy + type-255 mirror stay synced after position edits; the ISW beacon
   mast must point nose-ward in VIEW space (pins the Unity handedness fix); the
   ISW front caster wheel must hang below its pivot (suspension droop, display-only),
   the FluidJunction inlet must face view −y (flat builder-cache display pose —
   the cables are authored in that frame; see FORMAT.md), the ISW front aileron
   (saved `data.angle` in DEGREES = −4.609°) must droop a few degrees below its
   hinge (view tip y ≈ −0.08; the joint limit is ±45°),
   raycast picking must work through the mirrored component transforms; the
   v1 built-in palette must resolve WITHOUT a file palette (slot 48 = matte
   dark green, slot 53 cyan; v1 comp colours are slot-index
    pairs); the real Beacon model must carry the emissive red lens the game
    draws procedurally (user: "beacon no longer looks like a beacon");
     dashboard canvas text must be PRE-MIRRORED (`dashmirror=true`: a
     left-aligned label lands on the canvas RIGHT half) and baked text prims
     mirrored about their own centre (`textx=true`) — the orient fixture
     (testdata/9000000001, tools/make_orient_test.py) proved the game authors
     text readable from the plate's +normal side, so both layers need local
     counter-mirrors in our z-mirror chain (v105's normal-canvas/z-flip combo
     read mirrored from the pilot side = the v107 fix).
     legacy (no-palette) files must use RAW quaternions: the mosaic
     dashboard-mural plate normal must be parallel to its fitted wall plane
     (`mural=true`; conj quaternions tilt it ~45° out of the wall).
     the green ground plane + grid must sit just under the lowest rendered
     geometry — nothing of a craft renders below ground, ever (the
     3481322297 "Classic American Semi Truck" builds down to y=−1.5;
     `ground=true`).
     selecting a component must fire cable power-surges: one travelling
     pulse per connected pipe (data.pipes graph), the far component blips
     on arrival; pulses/blips/selection glow render additive with
     depthTest off — visible THROUGH the hull (`surges=true`).
     the windsock HUD is a camera child and its tail aims along flowDir()
     in camera space (`sock=true`, dot > 0.93 after an explicit updateWindHud);
     hull solids and wireframe are mutually exclusive checkboxes (`excl=true`);
     the wind particle budget tiers with scene cost, normal crafts full 4000
     (v0.156 "more wind particles, from further away": spawn box inflated
     4 m, kill margin 9 m; `windpts=true`); canvas picking = deliberate
     press only (`click=true`),
     and a subgrid hit CLOSER than any component routes the click to the
     subgrid info panel (v0.153 — content of a subgrid and anything BEHIND it
     lose; pinned in the dolphin postest, ISW has no subgrids);
     streamlines are UNDISTURBED upstream of the body mid-plane (`inflow=true`)
     while the wake deficit behind it slows the flow >25% (`wake=true`);
     pitching the PilotSeat must NOT steer/slow the wind (heading-only,
     `seatpitch=true`); display anchoring is a no-op on frame-(0,0,0) crafts
     like ISW (`anchor=true`). The rotate gizmo (Blender-style rings,
     v0.151) drags INTRINSIC (space='local'): each drag spins the axis
     the ring is CURRENTLY DRAWN along, so pitch-then-roll composes exactly
     as seen (user WYSIWYG rule); scene-root proxy, writeback qv = P·Ry(π)
     (THREE decompose absorbs the negative scale by negating sx). `gizmo=
     true` pins the writeback round-trip; `?gizmatest` (synthetic single-
     seat blueprint, camera facing the pilot, n=19 + &shot=1|2|3|4 visual
     states) pins the order algebra, the LIVE pose, and v0.156 KNOB
     CONTINUITY (`gizmoUnwrap`): TransformControls reports ring drags as a
     raw atan2 angle, so a knob sweep past 180° POPS back toward the start
     (user report) — the objectChange writeback unwraps per-event wrapped
     deltas into a continuous spin, both directions. Rings are thickened
     annuli at full opacity — v0.160: r169 builds them as HAIRLINE
     TorusGeometry (the v0.156 RingGeometry filter never matched), so the
     FAT tube instead of TGC's yellow flash (gizmostyle pin). v0.161 REVERT
     of v0.160's overreach: the swap thickened the REST state too (user: "a
     gizmo to rotate the gizmo and its always thick") — rings KEEP TGC's
     geometry at rest; ONLY the hovered/active ring fattens. v0.162 root
     cause of the residual "the WRONG axis rotater becomes yellow and thick,
     KEEP THE COLOR": TransformControls' highlight writes the MATERIAL of
     the raycast-hit mesh, and the pick meshes (helper's unnamed children;
     shared matInvisible at opacity 0.15 — NOT 0 as assumed) share one
     material across all axes, so a hover flashed every pick torus yellow
     at opacity 1 — fat yellow ghosts, positioned by the RAYCAST pick (at
     ring crossings the nearest torus is a different ring's visual). fix:
     styleGizmo restores _color/_opacity over the WHOLE helper subtree
     every rendered frame (paintHighlights) and fat-swaps only the active
     axis's VISIBLE rings (thickable = opacity ≥ 0.2; fattening the 0.15
     pick toruses would shrink the raycast area); NO opacity forcing — the
     active ring's colours stay theirs. The gizmostyle pin simulates TGC's
     exact shared-material write and asserts the restore. v0.163 FULL
     ROOT CAUSE (user: "the WRONG axis rotater becomes yellow and thick
     KEEP THE COLOR … large yellow circle, dont know which angle … then I
     select it is in a different spot"): (a) the trackball PICK torus
     (r 0.75 tube 0.1) is the nearest raycast hit for every screen point
     within 0.85 of the gizmo → EVERY ring hover set axis='E' → the yellow
     E ring blazed at opacity 1 + fattened, the intended rings never did;
     the restore ran in paintHighlights BEFORE the render, but Transform-
     Controls re-applies its flash inside the GIZMO'S OWN updateMatrixWorld
     (every rendered frame) — so styleGizmo is CHAINED onto the gizmo's
     updateMatrixWorld (original first, restore+fat-swap after, in the same
     pass, before anything draws). (b) the axis-less visible trackball
     rings E (yellow 25%) + XYZE (grey) are hidden (trackHide, material-
     guarded on opacity ≥ 0.2 so matInvisible's lazy _opacity cache is not
     poisoned). (c) the ring PICKERS (r0.5 tube0.1 → band 0.40..0.60) sit
     OUTSIDE the visible rings (r 0.40 = the band's grazing inner edge):
     reshaped to hug them (r 0.42 tube 0.07) so the fat ring lands ON the
     hovered ring ("does not show up where the actual one is"); E pick
     shrunk to a 0.16 sphere (trackball = centre drag only). (d) the gizmo
     ATTACHES AT THE PART'S VISIBLE CENTRE (bbox centre — the anchor of
     the mode widget/selection box/click; _gizOff centre→origin subtracted
     in applyGizmoPosition; v0.167: the quaternion writeback is NOT
     pivot-agnostic — a gizmo spin ORBITS the gizmo centre, p' = c +
     R(dq)·(p−c), c = bbox centre of the VISIBLE geometry (proxy ∪ real
     siblings, gizmoCentre; captured once per gesture at mouseDown) so
     off-origin real geometry (beacon mast, MiniComputer 3 m off) spins
     IN PLACE at the rings instead of lever-swings about the file origin
     (user: "the pivot locations dont seem to be properly positioned,
     causing parts to rotate/orbit around the wrong position"); mirror
     twins orbit their OWN centres (symRotPiv, captured at the same
     mouseDown — the mirrored self-centre IS the twin centre); sliders
     keep the game's pivot semantics (orientation about the part origin,
     no orbit); subgrid gizmos attach AT the joint pivot — unchanged). The
     gizmohover pin drives the REAL pointer path (synthetic canvas
     pointermove): ring hover picks its own ring (axis='Z'), TGC's RAW
     update flashes yellow, the SHIPPED chain clears it in-frame, the
     aimed ring fattens, E/XYZE stay hidden, proxy at centre. v0.164 (user:
     "they dont light up for the entire thing; make the thicker selected
     version match location of the normal handles"): EVERY visible handle
     mesh of EVERY mode (arrow shafts/tips, drag planes, centre octahedron,
     scale cubes, rings) gets a fat variant ⇒ the fattened hover state
     covers the WHOLE handle. v0.165 ROOT CAUSE of "the thicker selection
     handle for rotation STILL DOES NOT MATCH": r169's setupGizmo BAKES
     every per-mesh position/rotation/scale INTO the geometry, and
     updateGizmoResolution zeroes the PICKER meshes' rotations every frame
     — the three raw-torus ring pickers collapse into ONE coincident
     XY-plane torus, so TGC's first-surface picker raycast answers a
     DIFFERENT axis than the ring under the cursor, and raw-reconstructed
     fat handles land at the raw canonical pose (arrows h/2 low, rings in
     a neighbour plane). Fixes: fat variants CLONE-and-fatten the BAKED
     geometry IN PLACE (toruses scale the tube in its own plane about the
     ring CIRCLE — fanning about a semicircle's bbox centre shifts it;
     cylinders radial about the longest bbox axis; boxes/octahedra uniform
     about centre); hover picking replaces the picker raycast with
     ringPickerRaycast = a true ray↔ring-CIRCLE distance on the VISIBLE
     semicircle (RING_PLANE baked-plane basis, camera-side wins at
     crossings, scale-aware since TGC rescales handles per frame); the
     XYZE trackball PICK shrinks to E's 0.16 so ring hovers pick rings.
     styleGizmo fattens the active axis's meshes across the translate/
     rotate/scale groups (gizmofat pin: fat-vs-thin bbox CENTRES coincide
     + strictly fatter on every 'X' translate mesh, restores at rest);
     gizmohover aims via rayRingVis.Z.localToWorld (a proxy-local r0.5
     aim lands at 1.9× the shrunken ring TGC rescales per frame).
     The selection is boxed by a FAT 3.5px GOLDEN LineSegments2 outline,
     EXPANDED 0.07 m off the part, PULSING with the x-ray glow (outline=
     true: 12 segments on select, hidden on none; Box3Helper's 1px lines
     vanished on HiDPI — user "selection should be more clear"; v0.157
     "bigger highlight"; v0.160 gold + slimmer "slightly less thick"). Connectors
     (adapter nubs) default HIDDEN on their own View-Options toggle
     (conndef=true), pipes/cables keep theirs. The v0.153 MODE
     WIDGET: a canvas click on a part pops ⊘/✥/⟳/ℹ TIED TO THE PART
     (v0.156: projected bbox centre, re-projected every rendered frame
     while open — no/move/rotate/info; last choice persists,
     `archean-gizmo-mode`; v0.157: enlarged, v0.160: 26 px buttons
     "2-3 times bigger for better ux");
     v0.161 FIFTH BUTTON ⇄ = mirror-move switch (persisted `archean-sym`):
     twin propagation is ON only while symOn AND the selected part's pair is
     still mirrored — twins are filtered by symAllowed() at PRE-MOVE file
     positions in ALL position writebacks: both gizmo paths AND the
     inspector position sliders (livePos, v0.162 user: "mirror is not
     respected; I edited one wheel, it didnt do the other" — sliders were
     the manual path by design, the user corrected that: every position
     edit mirrors while the pair is aligned; computing the filter after the
     self-write makes every move drift its own pair and self-disable —
     caught by the XYQ pin). A pair a builder moved apart by >5 cm
     AUTO-DISABLES; the button shows the effective state with a
     strikethrough (CSS .off), so the user can also purposely disable.
     v0.164 CO-SELECTION (user: "I dont see the mirror-component being
     identified and co-selected"): while ⇄ is live and the pair aligned,
     the TWINS glow with the selection (shared pulsing x-ray overlay,
     rebuildSelXray; twinKey staleness ⇒ ⇄ flips/drifts repaint) and the
     first twin gets its own golden box (selBox2, synced in
     paintHighlights) — component twins AND subgrid (Build) twins alike
     (selectSub path included); twin SUBGRID groups also ride the mirrored
     delta in 3D (symPropagate writes twin g.userData.base.p +
     syncSubJoints — before, twin Builds moved in the file only). Pins:
     ISW symselect, XYQ symselect-sub.
     v0.166 MASK GENERALISATION + RED-AXIS FIX (user: "rotate two wheels
     that are symmetry linked, all axes behave correctly, exact the one
     that is red. If I move my wheel back, the mirrored wheel moves
     forward. Can you define robust logic … x, y or z symmetry?"): pairs
     are indexed with a MIRROR MASK (symMaskAt: every axis mirrored
     |a+b|≈0 & off-plane ∈ mask, every other axis must be equal; x/y/z,
     two-axis twists and point symmetry all compose; on-plane axes are
     EQUAL — the centreline rule per axis). Drift auto-disable = the live
     5 cm mask must EQUAL the indexed mask. Position deltas flip the mask
     axes; rotation deltas take the MIRROR-TWIN MOTION conjugation: the
     spin component along a mirror NORMAL is PRESERVED (both wheels roll
     backwards together), tangential spins flip (a steered pair yaws
     mirror-symmetrically) — md = det(S)·S·dq. v0.165 SHIPPED THE FULL
     quaternion conjugate (w,−x,−y,−z) — flipping the mirror-normal
     component too: exactly the red-axis wheel bug; its pins only tested
     ŷ/ẑ, so x̂ was never asserted (now: ISW symrot-x SmallWheel pair
     Rx(+0.2)→Rx(+0.2), XYQ symrot-sub x phase, uitest symrot pitch
     phase — all sign-sensitive). The mirror-plane overlay draws one
     plane per mirror axis present (twin masks ∪ mirrorAxis parts); the
     y-plane arrow pair straddles UPWARD so the down-tip lands ON the
     plane (selftest ground=true scans mirrorGroup).
     move = translate gizmo on the same proxy, writeback is the mirror
     involution (view z-flip) minus the compGroup display anchor, occ +
     type-255 mirror cells follow via serialize()'s round(delta/CELL) shift
     exactly like the position sliders — the gizmo never touches blueprint
     math. Shift snaps 15° AND 0.25 m cells. v0.158: SPACE IS PER-MODE —
     translate = WORLD (the arrows stay axis-aligned; user: "the move
     gizmo rotates and becomes non axis aligned, thats bad"), rotate =
     LOCAL rings (the pinned intrinsic model). movecfg pin asserts the
     space flip toggles with the mode. v0.159/v0.168: the gizmo ATTACHES TO
     SUBGRIDS TOO — selecting a subgrid attaches TransformControls to the
     shared scene-root PROXY, which rides the subgrid's CONTENT bbox CENTRE
     (v0.168: NOT the group — with the identity base the group origin is the
     parent grid origin, metres from the doors), and its translate space is
     LOCAL ("EXCEPT for subgrid, respect that rotation :)"): the arrows
     follow the subgrid's attach pose + joint swing. objectChange branches on
     the selected subgrid: translate maps the proxy DELTA onto the group pose
     and writes back through the JOINT INVERSE (subtract pivot/slide,
     rotate −a, reverse order) into g.userData.base, then the Build
     component (position mirror + rawFromView quat) — the same contract
     as the panel's pivot rows; ROTATE (subSpin) spins the group about the
     captured content CENTRE (p'=C+R(dq)·(p−C), q'=R(dq)·q0) — the WYSIWYG
     pivot rule (the identity-base origin spin was a huge lever swing).
     Pins: gizmatest movespace (MEASURED
     widget nodes: translate arrows proxy-INVARIANT, rings proxy-FOLLOWING)
     + dolphin subgizmo-move (local attach + sign-sensitive joint-inverse
     writeback on the 90°-open pivot door) + dolphin subgizmo-rot (v0.168:
     ring spin orbits the content centre, in-place, exact restore). The explode/assembly
     feature (v0.140/141) was
     REMOVED in v0.142 (user: "a catastrophe") — do not resurrect.
     thrust display + wind model: every DIRECTIONAL propulsor (THRUST
     table = .ini TARGET axes; Propeller double-headed + excluded from
     the net) feeds a normalized net-thrust vector, while the
     directionless RCS blob (5-way in the game, nothing stored in the
     file) renders/counts as a tail-ward push along −cockpit heading
     ONLY when it is the sole propulsion class — ISW net+main pin to
     view (0,0,−1), never the old straight-down TARGET-axis arrow
     (`thrust=true`); sealStats (blocks+occup+hatch blocks+triangle
     raster on cell = pos+12f−5.5, z-view) flood+ray-enclosure seals
     BionicDolphin's cabin (>100 cells) while ISW stays wind-swept;
     sampleVel is zero inside sealed cells (`seal=true cabin=…`). The
     selection is an incandescent X-ray overlay (shared-geometry meshes,
     matrix-synced every rendered frame so it tracks live edits), GOLDEN
     and PULSING (v0.160: x-ray opacity, emissive intensity and outline
     breathe together; the on-demand loop wakes only while a selection
     lives). Camera
     fly-in is MANUAL-only: canvas click, component-list double-click
     (never list single-click, ?sel= deep links, or selftest).
2. `regtest`: every testdata blueprint parses; blocks/components within bbox
   margins; the hull lattice map (when triangles exist) puts every vertex
   inside the bbox.
2b. `?comptest`: connector-alignment sweep over ISW-241 — every `data.pipes`
   endpoint (the game's own record of its port positions) must have an adapter
   nub ≤0.06 m, a cable tube ≤0.06 m, and the owning component's model surface
   ≤0.35 m. 60/60 PASS, PilotSeat (editor-moved) + Beacon (connector-frame
   endpoint quirk) exempt from the model check. Catches: tube chaining (pipes are
   NOT straight chains — anchor every segment at its own `start`), component
   pose/orientation, nub placement.
2c-b. `?uitest` (v0.147): headless UI sweep — drives EVERY panel control
   through its real handler (checkboxes, buttons, sliders, ⟲ resets) plus the
   paths state-pins miss: filter, LIST TABS (listtabs: by type / by subgrid,
   v0.156 — every flat part listed in both tabs, one search filters both,
   the pick persists), COLLAPSIBLE GROUPS (listcollapse: v0.157 groups start
   collapsed, header toggles; listclick also pins that a row-click AUTO-
   EXPANDS the containing group = the reveal path), list-click select,
   keyboard g/o/h (which
   must move groups AND stay synced with their checkboxes; h = blocks +
   triangles together), preset buttons (must actually MOVE the part — the
   row.set()/onInput dead-button bug), comp.data write-through, real-model
   toggle + localStorage persistence, wind-mode/flow-src/CoM/thrust buttons,
   hull-opacity slider (fades blocks + skin + wire together),
   hull-list flash row, Steam wslink, dirty→Save
   lifecycle, calibrated-mass report, ⟲ RE-PAINT pin (invalSeq), component-
   level ⟲ pin (compreset: proxy + real siblings move, repaints, and writes a
   PLAIN numeric file quaternion — spreading a THREE.Quaternion copies its
   _x/_y accessor BACKING = NaN quats at the next rebuild), rotate-gizmo
   attach/toggle pins, mode-widget pins (modebox: a synthetic canvas click
   pops the widget at the part, ⊘/✥/⟳ buttons drive tctl mode + attach state
   + localStorage; movemode: proxy drag writes comp.position RAW, moves mesh
   AND real siblings, undo through the same path; symwidget: the ⇄ button
   toggles twin propagation + persisted strikethrough state; symslider:
   inspector x-slider edits propagate the mirrored delta to the twin and
   the reverse edit restores the pair, v0.162; symrot: the inspector
   YAW slider (ŷ spin — spins TANGENTIAL to the mirror plane flip; the
   component along the mirror normal x̂ is PRESERVED) spins the twin
   aileron MESH by the MIRRORED delta Ry(−15°) (sign-sensitive) and the
   reverse edit restores the pair; v0.166 adds the PITCH phase (x̂ = the
   mirror normal: the twin takes Rx(+15°) PRESERVED — the red-axis wheel
   bug, slider-side), v0.165); pivotreal (v0.167, user: "the pivot
   locations dont seem to be properly positioned, causing parts to
   rotate/orbit around the wrong position"): real models ON, real Beacon
   geometry loaded (off-origin > 0.15 m asserted), a gizmo spin about
   x̂ keeps the part origin at a CONSTANT distance from the visible
   geometry's centre (proxy ∪ real bbox = the gizmo pivot) with the
   file position following, and the counter-spin restores exactly.

   (n counts ok() live, nothing hardcoded) /
   `UITEST FAIL <pins>`, captured errors in #out.
2c-c. `?gizmatest` (v0.151): rotate-gizmo ROTATION-ORDER suite on a
   synthetic single-PilotSeat blueprint, camera focused in front of the seat
   (user-suggested isolation). Asserts the PURE gizmoSpinRing/gizmoSpinEye
   contract (UI-free algebra: ring drag = intrinsic spin about the ring's
   drawn axis; trackball = eye-axis extrinsic; pitch90→roll90 order matters
   and uses the MOVED axis) + the shipped config (rotate/local) + the LIVE
   writeback through applyGizmoOrientation (file decode, mesh pose, ring
   tracking, visible nose swing) + v0.153 move-mode pins (movecfg: the mode
   switch toggles tctl translate↔rotate and persists; moveinv: the
   position writeback is the raw/mirror involution). v0.159 MOVESPACE pin
   MEASURES the rendered widget nodes: swinging the proxy 40° about z must
   move the translate ARROWS 0° (world space) and the rotate RINGS exactly
   40° (local space) — the empirical proof of the per-mode space split.
   `&shot=1|2|3|4` leaves
   the scene at
   before/+pitch90/+pitch90+roll90/RING-HOVER-FAT for headless eyeball
   (runner saves gizmo1..4.png; shot 4 aims the real pointer path at the
   visible Z ring and leaves it fattened — the v0.165 WYSIWYG proof that
   the fat ring COINCIDES with the thin one). Title: `GIZMATEST PASS n=19`.
2c. `?postest`: placement fixtures keyed per craft (the POSTESTS table in
   view3d.js — the sanctioned exception to "no per-craft constants": fixtures
   probe the RENDERED scene where generic checks cannot see a pose bug).
   ISW-241 + RCS-infinity (3518436870) FluidJunction rows: comb flat
   (world bbox y ≤ 0.40 m), one-height row at file y, cable endpoints on the
   −y side, ports ≤ 0.20 m of the model bbox (cable tips sit on visible
   sockets = 0.14 m off the proxy box). Guards the convention-independent
   junction display pose (FORMAT.md: file quat (w,−x,−y,z), never derived
   from the mapped view quat). Giant (3509975859) AERO-GRID pins (only
   grid-path craft, 1024 plates): grid ON, the 3×3×3 query is a SUPERSET of
   the influencing plates at 250 golden-ratio box points, freestream
   upstream, wake deficit >0.25 anchored on the first inserted solid cells
   (bbox-face probes fly through its sparse skin). Craft without fixtures
   report POSTEST SKIP.
   A GENERIC btn-* suite runs on every postest craft: ToggleButton renders
   exactly ONE lever (state picks axle/switch vs axle2/switch2), the lever
   centre matches the .ini derivation pivot+qV·mirror(Rz(0|−π)·Rx(18°)·
   (0,−0.16,−0.018)) within 0.07 m, and single-sided buttons show no base2.
   Catches state-ghost stacking (dolphin door buttons) in both rotations.
   v0.146: lever/plate expectations include the game's mount bake (local
   yaw-180, plate front on the mount face pilot-side — raw file quat leaves
   the plate 0.68 m behind the pivot = dolphin/Cede gap defect).
   v0.153 dolphin (3417786605) SUBGRID fixtures: one THREE.Group per Build
   subgrid (userData.sub), a ray from OUTSIDE the craft toward a door must
   route to the SUBGRID (front priority — the hull behind it loses),
   selectSub opens the info panel (Contents/Mount/Pivot rows) showing the
   DECODED master (sub-masters pin: 5 entries, Build[22]←SmallPivot), a
   pivot edit tracks the group live (via userData.base) with the file quat
   staying plain-numeric, and `subjoint-angle` spins that pivot's master to
   90°: the group must rotate EXACTLY 90° about the decoded axle axis
   (sign-sensitive dot>0.9999), swing about the pivot point, and return.
   XYQ-615 (3803780241) decodes Build[41]←ToggleButton, Build[5]←Dashboard, and
   its Build[5]/[41] ±0.635 TWIN SUBGRID PAIR proves symmove-sub (one
   door dragged, its twin rides the mirrored delta — dolphin's symmove pin
   does the same for SmallHinge twins, sign-sensitive in x).
   v0.161 XYQ `symmove-off`: with ⇄ clicked OFF a twin drag leaves its pair
   frozen, and a DRIFTED pair (twin moved alone → pair no longer mirrored)
   propagates NOTHING (auto-disable). v0.165 `symrot` (ISW): spinning the
   selected aileron via the gizmo writeback path (view Rz(+0.2)) must spin
   the twin's MESH by the MIRRORED delta Rz(−0.2) (sign-sensitive: spins
   tangential to the mirror plane flip) and follow its FILE quaternion,
   exact restore; XYQ `symrot-sub`: the same spin on a twin Build SUBGRID
   rides its `base.q` + file quat (door pair), and its v0.166 x-phase
   pins the MIRROR-NORMAL rule: Rx(+0.3) ⇒ twin Rx(+0.3) PRESERVED
   (v0.165's full-conjugate flipped it). ISW v0.166 `symrot-x`: rolling
   the SmallWheel pair (x=±3.125) about the red axis, self Rx(+0.2) ⇒
   twin Rx(+0.2) — same direction, sign-sensitive (user: "move my wheel
   back, the mirrored wheel moves forward"); its v0.167 phase captures
   the mouseDown pivots (self gizmo centre, twin its own centre) and
   pins the twin's orbit: constant twin-origin distance to its centre
   plus exact restore. dolphin `mirrorplane`: the striped
   sheet + frame + ⇄ arrows build on a symmetric craft, REST on the ground
   plane, and the View-Options checkbox toggles it — selftest ground=true
   now ALSO scans mirrorGroup ("nothing renders below ground" covers
   overlays; v0.160-era WIP plane pierced it, suite was blind).
   v0.157 gantry (3732302108) `subjoint-pos`: the LinearTrack-mastered
   subgrid slides +0.25 m along its decoded axle axis, and returns.
   Dev-shot hooks leave final states for headless screenshots: uitest
   `&wbshot` (mode widget + move gizmo on a part), postest `&subshot`
   (subgrid panel + widget at the door, camera flown to the master part).
3. `fitHull` must stay **generic**: zero per-craft constants. The exact lattice
   (W=12, pitch=CELL, C=−FRAME/2) passes on all 24 corpus files, not just ISW-241.

## Conventions
- view3d.js is one flat file with `// ---------- sections ----------`; follow it.
- UI = DevTools-style rows built by `row()`; new tunables get sliders, not prompts.
- Component list (v0.156 tabs, v0.157 collapsible): two tabs (`#ltabs`,
  persisted `archean-list-tab`) — `by type` (alphabetical sections) and
  `by subgrid` (one section per Build: decoded masters + indented nested
  rows whose click = selectSub; then 'Hull & parts (no subgrid)'), ONE
  search (`#filter`, position unchanged) filters both; rows carry the `.i`
  index badge, section headers are `.sec` (count spans must NOT use class
  `i` — uitest counts rows by it). Rows live inside a `.grp` container per
  section; groups are COLLAPSED by default (chevron on the header toggles;
  `listOpen` map keyed `tab|section`), a non-empty filter force-opens, and
  `select()`/`selectSub()` pass `{reveal:true}` which opens the containing
  group and scrolls the row into view (nested rows carry `data-b` = their
  Build index for the subgrid-tab reveal). The nose/tail/up nudge presets
  were REMOVED (user: meaningless — sliders + gizmo cover nudging); the
  PilotSeat lean presets stay (seatpreset pin).
- `row().set()` MUST repaint (it calls `invalidate()`): programmatic
  `.value` assignment fires no 'input' event, and the global input→invalidate
  listener is what keeps sliders live — without it ⟲/presets moved the UI but
  froze the picture (v0.149 user report).
- `markDirty()` MUST repaint (it calls `invalidate()`): BUTTON handlers mutate
  data too but fire no 'input' event, so the global input→invalidate listener
  cannot cover them — v0.152: "⟲ reset this component" updated data+sliders
  while the 3D view sat still (its real-model siblings + nubs must be synced
  there as well, mirroring livePos/liveRot).
- Keep headless testability: no top-level awaits on user input, report results in
  `document.title` / `#out` for `--dump-dom`. The suites live in
  `viewer/tests.js` (v0.169) and reach the core through `window.HARCHEAN`
  (accessor object of live getters/setters, exported at the bottom of
  view3d.js) — a global handle on purpose: tests.js is loaded by a dynamic
  import in index.html, so a static `import` with the release `?v=` specifier
  would be a SECOND app instance on one DOM (the v0.169 lesson: the split
  'worked' — every suite bound to the invisible twin).

## Backlog
- **Ring-drag rotation continuity (user-requested, v0.163+):** dragging a
  rotate ring must reference the UPDATED/ROTATED pose continuously, so a
  multi-grip sweep (grab ring, drag, release, re-grab) keeps rotating the
  part smoothly wherever it currently is; the accumulated angle must
  FLIP-OVER AND MODULO — raw per-event atan2 wraps unwrapped into a
  continuous spin (gizmoUnwrap) and full turns folded to the equivalent
  pose, never written as multiple-rotation noise. mouseDown already
  rebases knobQ0 to the live pose; future work: verify multi-grip sweeps
  end-to-end (pin), check the ring's drawn plane follows the live pose
  during re-grip, and confirm ±π/2π boundary drags stay continuous.
- **Git attribution: DONE 2026-10-10 (v0.165).** Repo identity is
  `Joeppie <3845457+Joeppie@users.noreply.github.com>` (GitHub noreply:
  links to the account without publishing the real mailbox); all 98
  historic commits + both annotated tags were rewritten with
  `git-filter-repo --mailmap` (verified metadata-only: every tree+message
  byte-identical pre/post) and force-pushed. API check: every published
  commit links to login Joeppie.
- **view3d.js is monolithic** (~5k lines, core): the headless test suites
  were split into `viewer/tests.js` in v0.169 (zero-build ES module, driven
  through the `window.HARCHEAN` hooks accessor — a GLOBAL handle on purpose:
  the page loads view3d.js with a per-release `?v=` cache-bust, and a static
  import from tests.js would resolve a SECOND module instance = two apps on one
  DOM). Remaining split (deferred): scene/render, gizmo, UI panels, subgrids,
  keeping the importmap/CDN, no-bundler constraint.
- Dashboard BUTTON elements (Toggle/Push/Arrow/Led) as real glTF models with
  the game's base transform + state animation (dev-viewer parity, transcribed
  in FORMAT.md §Handedness); today we draw plate+text approximations.
- Better flight-characteristics / stability analysis (beyond the stylized
  thin-plate model: full 360° velocity vector — nose may be ±X/±Z, automatic
  search of stable flight direction at low/high speed + ambiguity warning,
  trim/drag polar). User-requested, deliberately deferred.
- Aero model is stylized thin-plate (Cn = 2π·sinα·cosα), not CFD — label keeps.
- Joint animation is static (ailerons hinged at fixed droop from preview);
  in-game deflection state is not stored in the blueprint file.
- Optional before wider publishing: trim `testdata/` to the author's own craft
  (the other 23 files are other players' workshop copies — see NOTICE §2).
